### Step 3: Configure Database Settings

- Uncomment the following lines under 'sqlsrv':
    ```bash
    'encrypt' => env('DB_ENCRYPT', 'yes'),
    'trust_server_certificate' => env('DB_TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE', 'false'),
    ```
- Change the values:
    ```bash
    'encrypt' => env('DB_ENCRYPT', 'no'),
